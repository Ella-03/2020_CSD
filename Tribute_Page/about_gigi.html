	<h2>Growning Up</h2>
	<p style="font-size:25px">Gigi was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1936. Her mother was German and her father was Bulgarian.<br>
		As a child, Gigi was good friends with a girl next door. They would hangout around town, have parties at their houses, and do other fun activities.	
	</p>
	
	
	<h2 >WWII</h2>
	<p style="font-size:25px"> When the war started, Gigi's father knew that she would no longer be able to see her neighbor friend. Since her father was an American Translator,<br>
	 he also knew that his family would have to leave the country.<br>
	 <br>
	 Halfway through WWII, Gigi and her family fled the country by boat and started towards America. Sadly before leaving, she would experience horrors that<br>
	 no one should have to go through. Gigi's friend was shot since she was Jewish and one of the main bridges, that was located in front of her home, was bombed. 
	
	<h2>Presently</h2>
	<p style="font-size:25px">Gigi is currently 84 years young. She is married to Miff, who owns a furniture repair shop. Gigi has three kids and is a Grandmother to five and a<br>
	Great Grandmother to two.</p>
